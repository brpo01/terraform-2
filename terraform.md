# AUTOMATE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH IAC USING TERRAFORM

Let us continue to our Infrastructure Automation with Terraform. Based on the knowledge from the [previous](https://github.com/brpo01/terraform-1/blob/master/terraform.md) project lets keep on creating AWS resources!!.

![tooling_project_15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76074379/126079856-ac2b5dea-45d0-4f1f-85fa-54284a91a5de.png)

## Networking

Create 4 private subnets keeping in mind following principles:

- Make sure you use variables or length() function to determine the number of AZs

- Use variables and cidrsubnet() function to allocate vpc_cidr for subnets.

- Keep variables and resources in separate files for better code structure and readability
Tags all the resources you have created so far. 

- Explore how to use format() and count functions to automatically tag subnets with its respective number.

Tagging is a straightforward, but a very powerful concept that helps you manage your resources much more efficiently:

- Resources are much better organized in ‘virtual’ groups

- They can be easily filtered and searched from console or programmatically

- Billing team can easily generate reports and determine how much each part of infrastructure costs how much (by department, by type, by environment, etc.)

- You can easily determine resources that are not being used and take actions accordingly

- If there are different teams in the organisation using the same account, tagging can help differentiate who owns which resources.

**Note**: You can add multiple tags as a default set. for example, in out terraform.tfvars file we can have default tags defined.

```
tags = {
  Enviroment      = "production" 
  Owner-Email     = "opraise00@gmail.com"
  Managed-By      = "Terraform"
  Billing-Account = "1234567890"
}
```

Now you can tag all you resources using the format below:

```
tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = "Name of the resource"
    },
  )
```

**NOTE**: Update the *variables.tf* to declare the variable tags used in the format above:

```
variable "tags" {
  description = "A mapping of tags to assign to all resources."
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {}
}
```

## Internet Gateway Resource

- Create an Internet Gateway in a separate Terraform file internet_gateway.tf

```
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "ig" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = format("%s-%s!", aws_vpc.main.id,"IG")
    } 
  )
}
```

## NAT Gateway & Elastic IP Resource

- Create NAT Gateways and Elastic IP (EIP) resources based on the given reference architecture. Now use a similar approach to create the NAT Gateways in a new file called natgateway.tf.

```
resource "aws_eip" "nat_eip" {
  vpc        = true
  depends_on = [aws_internet_gateway.ig]

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = format("%s-EIP", var.name)
    },
  )
}

resource "aws_nat_gateway" "nat" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.nat_eip.id
  subnet_id     = element(aws_subnet.public.*.id, 0)
  depends_on    = [aws_internet_gateway.ig]

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = format("%s-Nat", var.name)
    },
  )
}
```
**Note**: We need to create an Elastic IP for the NAT Gateway, and you can see the use of depends_on to indicate that the Internet Gateway resource must be available before this should be created. Although Terraform does a good job to manage dependencies, but in some cases, it is good to be explicit.

## AWS Routes Resources

- Create a file called route_tables.tf and use it to create routes for both public and private subnets, create the below resources. Ensure they are properly tagged.

    - aws_route_table
    - aws_route
    - aws_route_table_association

```
# create private route table
resource "aws_route_table" "private-rtb" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = format("%s-Private-Route-Table", var.name)
    },
  )
}

# associate all private subnets to the private route table
resource "aws_route_table_association" "private-subnets-assoc" {
  count          = length(aws_subnet.private[*].id)
  subnet_id      = element(aws_subnet.private[*].id, count.index)
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.private-rtb.id
}

# create route table for the public subnets
resource "aws_route_table" "public-rtb" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = format("%s-Public-Route-Table", var.name)
    },
  )
}

# create route for the public route table and attach the internet gateway
resource "aws_route" "public-rtb-route" {
  route_table_id         = aws_route_table.public-rtb.id
  destination_cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
  gateway_id             = aws_internet_gateway.ig.id
}

# associate all public subnets to the public route table
resource "aws_route_table_association" "public-subnets-assoc" {
  count          = length(aws_subnet.public[*].id)
  subnet_id      = element(aws_subnet.public[*].id, count.index)
  route_table_id = aws_route_table.public-rtb.id
}
```

Now if you run **terraform plan** and **terraform apply** it will add the following resources to AWS in multi-az set up:

- Main VPC
- 2 Public subnets
- 4 Private subnets
- 1 Internet Gateway
- 1 NAT Gateway
- 1 EIP
- 2 Route tables

## AWS Identity and Access Management

### IaM and Roles

We want to pass an IAM role our EC2 instances to give them access to some specific resources, so we need to do the following:

1. Create AssumeRole -
Assume Role uses Security Token Service (STS) API that returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access AWS resources that you might not normally have access to. These temporary credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use AssumeRole within your account or for cross-account access. Add the following code to a new file named roles.tf

```
resource "aws_iam_role" "ec2_instance_role" {
name = "ec2_instance_role"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Sid    = ""
        Principal = {
          Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        }
      },
    ]
  })

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name = "aws assume role"
    },
  )
}
```
2. Create IAM policy for this role - 
This is where we need to define a required policy (i.e., permissions) according to our requirements. For example, allowing an IAM role to perform action describe applied to EC2 instances

```
resource "aws_iam_policy" "policy" {
  name        = "ec2_instance_policy"
  description = "A test policy"
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "ec2:Describe*",
        ]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      },
    ]

  })

  tags = merge(
    var.tags,
    {
      Name =  "aws assume policy"
    },
  )

}
```

3. Attach the Policy to the IAM Role - This is where, we will be attaching the policy which we created above, to the role we created in the first step.

```
 resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "test-attach" {
        role       = aws_iam_role.ec2_instance_role.name
        policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.policy.arn
    }
```
